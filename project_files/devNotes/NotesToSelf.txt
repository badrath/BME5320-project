1) draw out how I want to filter, then split out the query sequence results, then batch run them
	a) finding GO options:
		1) python script that runs qsubs of system commands
		2) python to split results into a batch file for each query sequence in a batch4GO directory within the data directory, 
			return the # of files created, 
			finally, create an array job that runs through running blastdbcmd on each of the resultant batch files,
	b) amalgamating GO returns
		1) go through each file retaining only the unique GO terms.
		2) concatenate these into a single line, for each query sequence
		3) go through the files from 1 to max, appending each line to a final output file.
